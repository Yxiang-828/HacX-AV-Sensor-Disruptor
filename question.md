# 5W1H Project Analysis


## WHO? 

**Organizers:** The event is organized by HTX and Microsoft.

**Presenter:** The briefing is conducted by Ken Zho, an Engineer from HTX.

**Participants:** Teams competing in the HacX! hackathon.

**Judges:** A panel from HTX, Home Team Departments, Microsoft, and SUTD.

## WHAT?

**The Challenge:** To build a physical prototype that can non-destructively disrupt the sensors of a hostile Autonomous Vehicle (AV) to mitigate threats.

**The Problem:** Hostile AVs, either pre-programmed or hijacked, can be used to deliver dangerous payloads or drive dangerously, posing a threat to public safety.

**The Goal:** The prototype must be able to disrupt the AV's perception or navigation, forcing it to brake or perform an emergency stop. The stretch goal is to disrupt more than one sensor type (e.g., LiDAR, camera, radar) to overcome system redundancies.

## WHERE?

**Deployment Zone:** The proposed solution is intended for roadside deployment, either from the ground level or from an overhead bridge.

## WHEN?

**Pitch Day:** The final presentation and judging will happen on November 12th.

## WHY?

**The Gap:** There is very little research on non-destructive methods for stopping hostile AVs.

**Current Limitations:** Previous research into LiDAR spoofing for moving targets suggested the required equipment would be too expensive and bulky for rapid, portable deployment by first responders. This hackathon seeks a more practical solution.

## HOW?

**Technical Parameters:**

- **Range:** Must be effective from at least 15 meters away.
- **Target Speed:** Must work on an AV moving up to 20 km/h.
- **Recommended Fields:** Participants are encouraged to explore areas like LiDAR/GPS spoofing, video interference, and signal generation.
- **Judging Focus:** Teams will be judged on innovation, functionality, practicality, and how well their solution fits the problem.

## Proposed Revolutionary Approach

Instead of trying to trick the car's sensors by creating a complex fake object—which is difficult and requires bulky equipment—our approach will be to create a "digital smoke bomb." We'll develop a small, portable device that emits a chaotic mix of light and radio signals. This digital noise won't give the AV a specific fake image to react to; instead, it will simultaneously overwhelm the LiDAR, camera, and radar sensors with garbage data, effectively making the car blind and deaf. Faced with this sudden and total loss of its senses, the AV's safety protocols will have no choice but to trigger an immediate emergency stop, neutralizing the threat quickly and simply.
