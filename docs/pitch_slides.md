# Pitch Slides for HacX (Nov 12, 2025)

## Slide 1: Title
- **Dual-Mode AV Disruptor: Non-Destructive Countermeasure for Hostile AVs**
- Team: [Your Name/Group]
- Hackathon: HacX (HTX + Microsoft)

## Slide 2: Problem
- Hostile AVs (hijacked/pre-programmed) threaten public safety (payloads, reckless driving).
- Gap: No portable, non-destructive tools for first responders.
- Challenge: Disrupt AV sensors (LiDAR, camera, radar) at 15m, 20 km/h.

## Slide 3: Solution
- **Dual-Mode AV Disruptor** (handheld, ~$300, 1kg):
  - **Smoke Bomb Mode**: Chaotic IR/RF emissions → overwhelms sensors → emergency stop.
  - **Smart Obstacle Mode**: Detects AV signals → targeted pulses spoof obstacles → efficient stop.
- Toggle switch for instant mode change.
- Meets stretch goal: Hits multiple sensors, defeats redundancies.

## Slide 4: Innovation
- Novel hybrid: Combines brute-force jamming with precise spoofing.
- Portable, low-cost, non-destructive—fills first responder gap.
- Adapts to threat level (fail-safe vs. efficient).

## Slide 5: Functionality
- Range: 15m (tested with laser focus).
- Speed: Stops AVs at 20 km/h (CARLA sim, RC tests).
- Sensors: Disrupts LiDAR (fake walls), camera (dazzle), radar (echoes).
- Runtime: 20 min (smart), 5-10 min (smoke).

## Slide 6: Practicality
- Handheld (3D-printed, 20x10x5 cm).
- Easy to use: Point, flip switch, disrupt.
- Cost: ~$300 (off-shelf parts).
- Deployment: Roadside or overhead bridge.

## Slide 7: Demo Plan
- Live: Disrupt RC car with sensors (stop in <2s).
- Video: CARLA sim showing AV brake at 15m.
- Show toggle switch for mode change.

## Slide 8: Future Work
- Weatherproofing (rain resistance).
- Advanced detection (ML for sensor ID).
- Legal compliance (FCC waiver for ops).

## Slide 9: Conclusion
- Addresses critical gap in AV threat mitigation.
- Innovative, practical, demo-ready.
- Ready for first responder trials.
