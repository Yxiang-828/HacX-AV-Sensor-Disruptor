# 5W1H Project Analysis

## WHO?
**Organizers**: HTX and Microsoft.
**Presenter**: Ken Zho, Engineer from HTX.
**Participants**: Teams in HacX! hackathon.
**Judges**: Panel from HTX, Home Team Departments, Microsoft, SUTD.

## WHAT?
**Challenge**: Build a physical prototype to non-destructively disrupt hostile AV sensors (LiDAR, camera, radar) to mitigate threats.
**Problem**: Hostile AVs (pre-programmed/hijacked) can deliver payloads or drive dangerously, threatening public safety.
**Goal**: Disrupt AV perception/navigation, force brake/emergency stop. Stretch goal: Disrupt multiple sensors to defeat redundancies.

## WHERE?
**Deployment**: Roadside (ground or overhead bridge).

## WHEN?
**Pitch Day**: November 12, 2025.

## WHY?
**Gap**: Little research on non-destructive AV stopping methods.
**Limitations**: Prior LiDAR spoofing too bulky/expensive for first responders. Hackathon seeks practical solutions.

## HOW?
**Parameters**:
- **Range**: ≥15m.
- **Target Speed**: ≤20 km/h.
- **Fields**: LiDAR/GPS spoofing, video interference, signal generation.
- **Judging**: Innovation, functionality, practicality, problem fit.
